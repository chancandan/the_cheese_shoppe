</div><br><br>




### Fonts
<br>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/READMEimages/fonts.JPG" alt="Fonts">
</div><br>

- The primary font Lato was chosen because of its modern and clean aesthetic, which aligns perfectly with the sophisticated yet approachable brand image of The Cheese Shoppe. Lato, designed by ≈Åukasz Dziedzic, offers excellent readability with its semi-rounded details and strong structure, making it versatile for both digital and print use. Its neutrality and elegance ensure that the focus remains on the content, whether it's product descriptions, blog posts, or user interfaces. Furthermore, Lato's wide range of weights allows for flexible design applications, from bold headlines to subtle body text, enhancing the overall user experience on the site. This choice reflects our commitment to providing a seamless and enjoyable browsing experience for our customers, reinforcing the quality and professionalism of The Cheese Shoppe brand.

### Icons
<br>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/READMEimages/icons.JPG" alt="Icons">
</div><br>
<br>

Icons sourced from the Font Awesome Icon library are implemented as classes within the <i> tag.
- Because these icons are utilised as classes, they can be effortlessly styled using other classes or IDs within the same tag. 
- Bootstrap classes are frequently employed to ensure uniform styling. 
 

### Colors
<br>
<div align="center">
  <img src="assets/READMEimages/colour_scheme.JPG" alt="Color Pallette">
</div><br>
<br>
- While it might look at first glance like little effort was put into the colour palette choices, it was quite the opposite. I wanted a clean, modern, and elegant look for the site and to let the colour yellow in every cheese stand out on the site, so I felt choosing this colour palette would achieve this. The yellow colour in the palette image above was in anticipation of the yellow from the cheese images being prominent on the site.

The colours #222222, #FFFFFF, #000000, and #212529 were carefully chosen to create a harmonious and sophisticated visual experience:

#222222 (Dark Gray): This dark gray coluor provides a strong, neutral backdrop that adds depth and sophistication to the website. It is less harsh than pure black, making it easier on the eyes for background use while still ensuring text and images stand out clearly.

#FFFFFF (White): White is the ultimate neutral colour that signifies cleanliness and simplicity. It creates a sense of openness and space on the website, allowing other elements, especially the vibrant yellow from the cheese images, to stand out without overwhelming the viewer.

#000000 (Black): Black is used to provide high contrast, making text and other important elements easily readable. It adds a touch of elegance and authority to the site, balancing the overall aesthetic.

#212529 (Near Black): This nearly black shade is slightly softer than pure black, adding subtlety and depth to the design. It works well for text and headers, providing excellent readability and a modern look without the starkness of true black.

Together, these colours create a cohesive and visually appealing design that highlights the key elements of the site, especially the cheese products, while ensuring a pleasant user experience.

I used coolors.co to help created my colour pallette for the The Cheese Shoppe

# Deployment
## Local Deployment
### Local Preparation
**Requirements:**
- An IDE of your choice, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- You will have to set up a connection with an email server through EmailJS:
- You will have to install SASS to compile the CSS. This depends on your system and your method choice. Please see the instructions [here](https://sass-lang.com/install).

### Local Instructions
1.  You can clone the repository with:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/chancandan/the_cheese_shoppe
    ```
    To disconnect it from the master repository, use:
    ```
    git remote rm origin
    ```
2. Open your IDE and choose the base directory.
3. Here you can install SASS with npm, if you choose, with:
    ```
    npm install -g sass
    ```
4. Run the compiler with:
    ```
    sass --watch assets/css/bootstrap_sass:assets/css
    ```
    This will also watch the bootstrap_sass folder for changes and re-compile the CSS when they are made. This way you can make changes quickly and not worry about re-compiling.
6. Switch the user token for EmailJS with your own. It can be found in the head tag:
    ```
    (function () {
        emailjs.init("<your user token>");
    })();
    ```
5. Run the project with your chosen method. You can drop index.html into a web browser and it should run fine, open a local port and access it or, if you have python installed, run it on an HTTP server with python with a command such as:
    ```
    python3 -m http.server
    ```

## Github Deployment
### Github Preparation
- It is possible to copy or clone the repository directly for deployment, but you will have to compile to make sure the SCSS compiles correctly first. Github Pages' Jekyll themes support this but you will have to make some customisations. Details can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/).
**Requirements:**
- A free GitHub account.

### Github Instructions
1. Log in to your GitHub account.
navigate to [https://github.com/chancandan/the_cheese_shoppe](https://github.com/chancandan/the_cheese_shoppe).
1. You can set up your own repository and copy or clone it, or you fork the repository.
2. `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` to a GitHub repository, if necessary.
3. GitHub pages will update from the master branch by default.
4. Go to the **Settings** page of the repository.
5. Scroll down to the **Github Pages** section.
7. Select the Master Branch as the source and **Confirm** the selection.
8. Wait a minute or two and it should be live for viewing.

## Credits and Contact
### Content
Nearly all text content was generated by the AI, GPT-4. Especially for product descriptions.
Most of my Images were screenshots of cheese items across sites such as (https://www.pexels.com) and then I also used Canva.
I used screenshots but then always made sure to change to title and description of products and made up random prices.
